# Dining Philosophers Problem

A C implementation of the classic **Dining Philosophers Problem** using pthreads, demonstrating concurrent programming concepts and synchronization mechanisms.

## üçΩÔ∏è What is the Dining Philosophers Problem?

The Dining Philosophers Problem is a classic computer science problem that illustrates challenges in resource allocation and deadlock prevention in concurrent systems.

### The Scenario

Imagine a round table with **N philosophers** sitting around it. Between each pair of philosophers, there is exactly **one fork**. Philosophers alternate between **thinking** and **eating**. To eat, a philosopher needs **two forks** (the one to their left and the one to their right).

```
        Philosopher 1
           /    \
    Fork 1        Fork 2
   /                  \
Philosopher 5    Philosopher 2
   \                  /
    Fork 5        Fork 3
           \    /
        Philosopher 4
           /    \
    Fork 4        Fork 4
           \    /
        Philosopher 3
```

### The Challenge

The problem arises when all philosophers try to eat simultaneously:
1. Each philosopher picks up their left fork
2. Each philosopher waits for their right fork (which is held by their neighbor)
3. **Deadlock occurs** - no philosopher can eat, and they all starve

## üöÄ How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler
- Make utility
- Linux/Unix system (for pthreads support)

### Building the Project
```bash
cd philo
make
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./philo [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```

### Example Usage
```bash
# 5 philosophers, die after 800ms without eating, take 200ms to eat, sleep for 200ms
./philo 5 800 200 200

# Same as above, but each philosopher must eat exactly 7 times
./philo 5 800 200 200 7
```

## üìä Program Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `number_of_philosophers` | Number of philosophers (and forks) | `5` |
| `time_to_die` | Time in milliseconds before a philosopher dies of starvation | `800` |
| `time_to_eat` | Time in milliseconds it takes for a philosopher to eat | `200` |
| `time_to_sleep` | Time in milliseconds a philosopher spends sleeping | `200` |
| `number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat` | Optional: Program stops when all philosophers eat this many times | `7` |

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Initialization Phase
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Parse Command Line Arguments] --> B[Validate Input]
    B --> C[Initialize Philosopher Structures]
    C --> D[Create Forks as Mutexes]
    D --> E[Create Threads for Each Philosopher]
    E --> F[Start Philosopher Routines]
```

### 2. Philosopher Life Cycle
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Think] --> B[Pick Up Left Fork]
    B --> C[Pick Up Right Fork]
    C --> D[Eat]
    D --> E[Put Down Forks]
    E --> F[Sleep]
    F --> A
```

### 3. Fork Management Strategy

To prevent deadlock, the program uses a **memory address-based ordering** strategy:

```c
// Philosophers always pick up forks in the same order
// (lower memory address first)
if (philo->left_fork < philo->right_fork)
{
    pthread_mutex_lock(philo->left_fork);
    pthread_mutex_lock(philo->right_fork);
}
else
{
    pthread_mutex_lock(philo->right_fork);
    pthread_mutex_lock(philo->left_fork);
}
```

This ensures that if two philosophers want the same fork, they will always try to acquire it in the same order, preventing circular wait conditions.

## üõ°Ô∏è Synchronization Mechanisms

### Mutexes (Mutual Exclusion)
- **Fork Mutexes**: Each fork is protected by a mutex
- **Print Mutex**: Ensures output messages don't get mixed up
- **Death Mutex**: Protects the global death flag

### Death Monitoring
A "big brother" structure monitors all philosophers:
```c
typedef struct big_brother_is_watching_u
{
    pthread_mutex_t dead_mutex;
    long            dead_flag;
} t_big;
```

When any philosopher dies, the flag is set to 1, and all threads terminate gracefully.

## üìù Output Format

The program outputs timestamped messages showing each philosopher's actions:

```
[timestamp] [philosopher_id] has taken a fork
[timestamp] [philosopher_id] is eating
[timestamp] [philosopher_id] is sleeping
[timestamp] [philosopher_id] is thinking
[timestamp] [philosopher_id] died
```

### Example Output
```
0 1 has taken a fork
0 1 has taken a fork
0 1 is eating
200 1 is sleeping
200 2 has taken a fork
200 2 has taken a fork
200 2 is eating
400 1 is thinking
400 2 is sleeping
```

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Functionality
```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200
```
**Expected**: All philosophers should eat, sleep, and think without dying.

### Test 2: Death Scenario
```bash
./philo 4 410 200 200
```
**Expected**: One philosopher should die due to starvation.

### Test 3: Single Philosopher
```bash
./philo 1 800 200 200
```
**Expected**: Philosopher takes one fork and dies (can't eat with only one fork).

### Test 4: Meal Limit
```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200 7
```
**Expected**: Program stops when all philosophers eat exactly 7 times.

## üîç Code Architecture Highlights

### Main Data Structures

```c
typedef struct philo
{
    long            thread_id;        // Philosopher ID
    long            nb_philo;         // Total number of philosophers
    long            time_to_die;      // Time before death
    long            time_to_eat;      // Time to eat
    long            time_to_sleep;    // Time to sleep
    long            nb_must_eat;      // Required meals (optional)
    pthread_mutex_t *left_fork;       // Left fork mutex
    pthread_mutex_t *right_fork;      // Right fork mutex
    pthread_mutex_t print_mutex;      // Output synchronization
    t_big           *watcher;         // Death monitoring
} t_philo;
```

### Thread Safety Features
- **Atomic Operations**: All shared data access is protected
- **Mutex Ordering**: Prevents deadlock through consistent lock ordering
- **Condition Checking**: Regular death checks during operations

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Mixed Output Messages
**Solution**: All output is protected by a print mutex to ensure clean, ordered output.

### Issue: Timing Inaccuracy
**Solution**: Custom `precise_usleep` function provides microsecond-level timing precision.

### Issue: Resource Leaks
**Solution**: Comprehensive cleanup in main function destroys all mutexes and frees memory.
